### talk
> title slide
Thank you for the introduction, Volker!

Welcome to my PhD defense! I am happy to see you all here. In particular to see the familiar faces that traveled from far places.  I probably share my nervousness with my family and some of my close friends ;)

First, I want to thank the six members of the examination board for kindly agreeing to evaluate my performance today.  (in case VB forgot) I welcome:
- VB, my PhD supervisor,
- Ansgar Reiners, the second member of the thesis committee,
- and the further members:
- Stefan Dreizler,
- Wolfram Kollatschny,
- Andreas Tilgner, from the Institute for Geophysics,
- and Hardi Peter, from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research.


Now, I will present one of the studies I included in my thesis and after that I will defend my thesis against critical questions.


> two topics
The title of my thesis goes: "The solar wind's geomagnetic impact and its Sun--Earth evolution -- Predictive models for space weather and for the Parker Solar Probe orbit".
You can already see from the title, that my thesis consists of two major parts. Both parts are independent studies, that focus on different aspects of the solar wind.

The first study deals with the influence of the solar wind on the terrestrial magnetosphere. This study derives predictive models that estimate the average geomagnetic activity caused by specific solar wind parameters. These parameters are the solar wind electric field, the velocity of coronal mass ejections and the velocity of solar wind streams.

The second study develops an empirical solar wind model for the inner heliosphere. It further extrapolates the model to the near-Sun region, in order to predict the solar wind environment the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft will fly through during its mission.

In this talk, I will not address the study on geomagnetic impact of the solar wind but present the study on the solar wind model. The reason why I chose this one, is because it is a very current topic. The Parker Solar Probe spacecraft was launched in August and its first perihelion will occur 5 days from now -- next Tuesday.


> outline
the outline of the talk
I will begin with a short introduction on solar activity, the solar wind and the Parker Solar Probe mission. After that, I will tell you how I built the solar wind model and what the resulting solar wind predictions for the PSP orbit are.


> solar activity
This is an image of the Sun taken in 2013. There are lots of sunspots visible.
This image of the Sun was taken three days ago (when I updated my slides) -- without sunspots.

The number of sunspots shows a periodicity of 11 years. This solar cycle was discovered in 1843.
In this plot you can see the monthly sunspot number since 1954. The amplitudes of the solar cycles are quite variable.

[magnetogram figure]
Sunspots are caused by strong magnetic flux that rises from the convection zone through the solar surface. This flux inhibits the convection locally and leads to a lower temperature and brightness of the photosphere.

The flux from sunspots contributes to the outer solar magnetic field. In the near-Sun solar atmosphere, the field dominates the structure and movements of the coronal plasma. That is, the plasma follows the lines of the magnetic field.
[171AA figure]

With increasing solar distance, the magnetic field gets weaker and eventually, at a distance of a few solar radii, the magnetic pressure falls below the thermal pressure of the plasma. The consequence is, that the magnetic field gets locked within the plasma. Now, the plasma can flow freely, carrying the solar magnetic field out into the heliosphere.

The solar wind is this continuous outflow of magnetized plasma. It consists mainly of electrons and protons -- with a helium share that varies around 5 % and with traces of heavier ions.


> solar wind
In 1958, Parker formulated a theoretical model for an expanding solar atmosphere. He considered the consequences of the solar rotation, for the geometry of the magnetic field in the heliosphere. The field geometry is now called the "Parker spiral".
[Parker spiral figure]

The first satellites confirmed the existence of solar wind in 1959. Since then, the solar wind has been monitored almost continuously near Earth.




- solar magnetic field (near-Sun field geometry, Parker spiral)
- solar activity cycle (sunspots + Ulysses figure)
- slow/fast wind (CH image and in-situ plot)
- CMEs (coronagraph + in-situ plot + 3-part structure)


[The ratio between thermal and magnetic pressure is called plasma beta.
beta = p_therm / p_mag]
[So the sunspot number is a measure for the activity of the outer solar magnetic field and commonly used as a measure for solar activity.]
[This distance is called the source surface -- from here the solar wind streams radially away into space. Due to the solar rotation with a period of about 27 days, the magnetic field of the solar wind is shaped in an Archimedean spiral pattern, called the Parker spiral. At the distance of Earth, the spiral angle is on average about 45 degrees.]



> first study slides
- solar wind interacts with the terrestrial magnetosphere (magnetosphere figure, Davies 1990)
- coupling mechanisms (reconnection, turbulence, compression and induction), individual contributions are not yet established
- reconnection during southward magnetic field (antiparallel), Dungey convection cycle, substorms originating from the magnetotail
- variations in solar wind lead to geomagnetic disturbances
- geomagnetic storms are directly caused by the incoming solar wind flow (Carrington, CMEs)
- (space weather) effects of disturbances/storms: auroral position and activity, enhanced radiation in polar cap region, enhanced radiation in Van Allen belt, satellite drag from expanding upper atmosphere, induced currents in surface infrastructure, magnetopause can be pressed below GEO satellites, migratory animals are influenced
questions: coupling processes
current problems: prediction of space weather effects
aims: estimating the size of geomagnetic disturbances for specific forecast situations (CMEs + streams)
methods: correlating near-Earth solar wind measurements with the geomagnetic disturbance indicator Kp; data sets; processing different data resolutions; deriving dependencies for the solar wind electric field and the velocity of CMEs and streams; evaluation of the prediction performance
results: relations that predict the size of the Kp impact from the solar wind electric field and from the velocity of CMEs and streams; in case of the electric field coupling function, 3-hour extrema correlate significantly better than 3-hour averages; in case of the velocity, the underlying resolution is less important; prediction methods based on full-fledged coupling functions or artificial neural networks perform better than the derived relations
conclusions: data resolution and processing method are very important for the correlation of the electric field (short-term magnetic structures have a significant influence on the Kp index); the derived relations provide decent results for the limited input information
outlook?


> second study slides
- solar wind history (comets, Parker, satellite measurements)
- solar wind measured throughout the heliosphere, not near-Sun
questions: coronal heating and solar wind acceleration
current problems: Parker Solar Probe (mission goals)
aims: building an empirical solar wind model for the inner heliosphere and predicting the near-Sun solar wind properties PSP will encounter during its perihelia
article: the major part of this study is published in the article Venzmer & Bothmer (2018) in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics
methods: from existing in-situ measurements of the key solar wind parameters magnetic field strength, proton velocity, density, and temperature; shifting and scaling their frequency distributions according to solar activity and solar distance; their 1 au frequency distributions are represented with lognormal functions (two for the velocity); the distributions' shift is correlated with the sunspot number as an indicator for solar activity; power-law relations are obtained from their solar distance dependencies using Helios measurements from the distance range 0.29--0.98 au (considering Parker geometry for the magnetic field); combining both dependencies into one model; prediction for PSP's orbital trajectory, in particular to its first and to its closest perihelia; by extrapolation to near-Sun distances and using SSN predictions for the next solar cycle
results: relations for key solar wind parameters that depend on the SSN and solar distance, representing the frequency distributions in the inner heliosphere; predictions for PSP's near-Sun solar wind environment; the near-Sun values for velocity and temperature are overestimated compared to remote observations
conclusions: the velocity and temperature discrepancies suggest that solar wind heating and acceleration takes place up until 20 Rs
outlook?

### questions

## general

what else did you do?
- several precursor studies for both topics (data time resolution, processing method, data set, coupling functions)
- classification of solar wind structures (CMEs, MCs, HSSs, CIRs, SIRs, HCSs, shocks, compression zones)
- magnetic cloud modeling (minimum variance analysis, synthetic MC field structure)

## first


## second

what are the proposed mechanisms for the coronal heating and the solar wind acceleration?
heating mechanisms:
acceleration mechanisms:

what are the possible sources of slow solar wind?
- CH boundaries and small CHs, high superradial expansion of open field lines
- CH boundaries, released plasma from reconnections between open and closed lines
- Helmet/pseudo-streamers in active regions, released transient plasma blobs -> HPS belt
- Jets from coronal bright points
- Slow unidentified CMEs


why estimating the solar wind there now when the PSP will measure it anyway soon?

what is this study good for?
in general: -> It provides reference values for the key solar wind parameters in the inner heliosphere.
in terms of WISPR: -> talk to GN...
in terms of PSP: -> The model can be used as a guide for the classification of the first measurements (higher/lower end).

why the use of probability distributions instead of averages?
-> because this also provides the estimation for the possible extreme values

Why the focus exactly on these four solar wind parameters?
-> they are the key quantities that describe a magnetized plasma
-> many properties can be derived from these key parameters: plasma beta, pressures, and flux densities

VB:
How do aurorae form?
-> Geomagnetic substorms. Reconnections in the magnetotail release electrons and ions that follow the field lines to the polar footpoints. These particles excite atoms and molecules in the upper atmosphere (in particular oxygen and nitrogen), which emit the polar light.

H. Peter:
- why is it so difficult to predict the in-situ magnetic field of CMEs, even if the magnetic configuration of their source region is known?
