Thank you for the introduction... (including the defense committee members)

Welcome to my defense! I am happy that you all came, in particular to see so many familiar faces. I probably share my nervousness with my family and some of my close friends ;)

First, I thank the six members of my defense committee for kindly agreeing to evaluate my defense performance (name them in case VB forgot).

Today I will present to you the studies I included in my thesis and after that defend my thesis against critical questions.

> two topics
% "The solar wind's geomagnetic impact and its Sun--Earth evolution -- Predictive models for space weather and for the Parker Solar Probe orbit".
You can already see from the title of my thesis that it consists of two major parts. Both parts are focused on different aspects of the solar wind.

The first part deals with the influence of the solar wind on the terrestrial magnetosphere. This study derives predictive models for estimating the magnitude of geomagnetic disturbances that are caused by solar wind and coronal mass ejections.

The second part develops a solar wind model for the inner heliosphere. This study also predicts the near-Sun solar wind which the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft is flying into during its mission.

> contents
In this talk, I will briefly present both parts and describe the studies I performed. However, there is only half an hour, so I will only describe the methods and results of one study in greater detail. That is, I focus on the second study, because it is a very current topic due to the recent launch of the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft and its first perihelion in X days on xxday.

I still begin with introducing the solar wind and some of its major properties that are relevant for this work.

> solar wind slides
Solar wind
- history (comets, Parker, satellite measurements)
- solar magnetic field (near-Sun field geometry, Parker spiral)
- solar activity cycle (sunspots + Ulysses figure)
- slow/fast wind (CH image and in-situ plot)
- CMEs (coronagraph + in-situ plot)

> first study slides
- solar wind interacts with the terrestrial magnetosphere (magnetosphere figure, Davies 1990)
- coupling mechanisms (reconnection, turbulence, compression and induction), individual contributions are not yet established
- reconnection during southward magnetic field (antiparallel), Dungey convection cycle, substorms originating from the magnetotail
- variations in solar wind lead to geomagnetic disturbances
- geomagnetic storms are directly caused by the incoming solar wind flow (Carrington, CMEs)
- (space weather) effects of disturbances/storms: auroral position and activity, enhanced radiation in polar cap region, enhanced radiation in Van Allen belt, satellite drag from expanding upper atmosphere, induced currents in surface infrastructure, magnetopause can be pressed below GEO satellites, migratory animals are influenced
questions: coupling processes
current problems: prediction of space weather effects
aims: estimating the size of geomagnetic disturbances for specific forecast situations (CMEs + streams)
methods: correlating near-Earth solar wind measurements with the geomagnetic disturbance indicator Kp; data sets; processing different data resolutions; deriving dependencies for the solar wind electric field and the velocity of CMEs and streams; evaluation of the prediction performance
results: relations that predict the size of the Kp impact from the solar wind electric field and from the velocity of CMEs and streams; in case of the electric field coupling function, 3-hour extrema correlate significantly better than 3-hour averages; in case of the velocity, the underlying resolution is less important; prediction methods based on full-fledged coupling functions or artificial neural networks perform better than the derived relations
conclusions: data resolution and processing method are very important for the correlation of the electric field (short-term magnetic structures have a significant influence on the Kp index); the derived relations provide decent results for the limited input information
outlook?

> second study slides
- solar wind measured throughout the heliosphere, not near-Sun
questions: coronal heating and solar wind acceleration
current problems: Parker Solar Probe (mission goals)
aims: building an empirical solar wind model for the inner heliosphere and predicting the near-Sun solar wind properties PSP will encounter during its perihelia
article: the major part of this study is published in the article Venzmer & Bothmer (2018) in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics
methods: from existing in-situ measurements of the key solar wind parameters magnetic field strength, proton velocity, density, and temperature; shifting and scaling their frequency distributions according to solar activity and solar distance; their 1 au frequency distributions are represented with lognormal functions (two for the velocity); the distributions' shift is correlated with the sunspot number as an indicator for solar activity; power-law relations are obtained from their solar distance dependencies using Helios measurements from the distance range 0.29--0.98 au (considering Parker geometry for the magnetic field); combining both dependencies into one model; prediction for PSP's orbital trajectory, in particular to its first and to its closest perihelia; by extrapolation to near-Sun distances and using SSN predictions for the next solar cycle
results: relations for key solar wind parameters that depend on the SSN and solar distance, representing the frequency distributions in the inner heliosphere; predictions for PSP's near-Sun solar wind environment; the near-Sun values for velocity and temperature are overestimated compared to remote observations
conclusions: the velocity and temperature discrepancies suggest that solar wind heating and acceleration takes place up until 20 Rs
outlook?

### questions

## general

what else did you do?
- several precursor studies for both topics (data time resolution, processing method, data set, coupling functions)
- classification of solar wind structures (CMEs, MCs, HSSs, CIRs, SIRs, HCSs, shocks, compression zones)
- magnetic cloud modeling (minimum variance analysis, synthetic MC field structure)

## first


## second

what are the proposed mechanisms for the coronal heating and the solar wind acceleration?
heating mechanisms:
acceleration mechanisms:

why estimating the solar wind there now when the PSP will measure it anyway soon?

what is this study good for?
in general: -> It provides reference values for the key solar wind parameters in the inner heliosphere.
in terms of WISPR: -> talk to GN...
in terms of PSP: -> The model can be used as a guide for the classification of the first measurements (higher/lower end).

why the use of probability distributions instead of averages?
-> because this also provides the estimation for the possible extreme values

why the focus exactly on these four solar wind parameters?
-> because many properties can be derived from these key parameters: beta, pressure, see paper...

VB:
- how do aurorae form?

H. Peter:
- why is it so difficult to predict the in-situ magnetic field of CMEs, even if the magnetic configuration of their source region is known?
